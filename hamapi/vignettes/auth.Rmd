This vignette covers how to obtain and use Harvard Art Museum API access tokens for use in the `hamapi` package.

The Harvard Art Museums API is a REST-style service designed for developers who wish to explore and integrate the museumsâ€™ collections in their projects. In order to use this package, Harvard Art Museum asks you to apply for a token. Detailed explaination can be found at the official website: (https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api)

- Obtain a personal token
The API uses keys to authenticate requests. Every request must be accompanied by the apikey parameter and an API key.
Please follow the link and input your information: (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmEBqH76HLMMiCC-GPPnhcvHC9aJS86E32dOd0Z8MpY2rvQ/viewform)

Harvard Art Museum is using an automatic reply system, so you will be receiving an email with your token soon. 

### get_token()
This function will send a pop-up window to ask you for your token. 
```{r}
#Please input your token. (WITHOUT THE ' ')
get_token()

#Congrats! Your token is now saved as a global variable and can be used in other functions in this package. 
```


Enjoy your art journey!
